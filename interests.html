    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
    <p>
      As an apprentice in CTAC, I am looking forward to learning all I need to
      know succeed in my upcoming career as a full-stack developer. I have
      already learned basic HTML and CSS, and I am eager to start learning
      JavaScript and other programming languages. At the end of the cohort, I
      hope to be hired by a large company in a role focused on back-end
      development.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
    <p>
      In my personal life, my hobbies include playing chess and the bass guitar.
      I am a fan of the Queen's Gambit and Caro-Kann Defense, and I am always
      working to improve my knowledge of the game. My musical interests are
      varied, but lately I've been enjoying the virtuostic compositions of the
      classic rock band <i>Mr. Big</i>. Billy Sheehan is a master of his craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a big fan of Boston sports, particularly the
      <span class="bruins" style="color: gold; text-decoration: underline black 3px;">Bruins</span> and the <span class="patriots" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 199); text-decoration: underline red 3px;">Patriots</span>. Of course, I'll be rooting for the <span class="celtics" style="color: rgb(0, 190, 0); text-decoration: underline white 3px;">Celtics</span> in their upcoming NBA Finals matchup with the Mavericks.</p>
